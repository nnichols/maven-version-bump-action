# Maven Version Bump Action

A simple GitHub Actions to bump the version of Maven projects.

When triggered, this action will look at the commit message of HEAD~1 and determine if it contains one of `#major`, `#minor`, or `#patch` (in that order of precedence).
If true, it will use Maven to bump your pom's version.

You can override this default behavior by setting a release type, setting type will override the above commit message check.

For example, a `#minor` update to version `1.3.9` will result in the version changing to `1.4.0`.
The change will then be committed.

## Sample Usage
